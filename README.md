# MergeSort

Merge sort is very useful and one of the easier divide-and-conquer algorithms to understand. It's easier to conceptualize than some of the other ones. A key to merge sort is that it is recursive. The basic gist of merge sort is that you're going to take your big list, and first divide down in two half size lists and recursively call merge sort on those smaller list, which in turn will do the same. The base case is when you have a list of one, at which point you will return that sorted list of one. On the way up the recursive calls, you will merge those sorted lists together (another merge function) that walks through both lists simultaneously and inserts the smaller value first, effectively creating a bigger sorted list.
